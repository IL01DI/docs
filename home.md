Hello, guest from afar!

Welcome to _Al Vignh_'s Digital Garden! For the best experience, I advice you to download [my vault](https://github.com/IL01DI/dg) and view it on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) offline.

# Installation

To install (or 'attach') my vault on your Obsidian, you must have downloaded it first.

# Organization

Before exploring around, take a look first in how I organize my vault, so you would not get lost by any chance.

## Folders

As for now, the folders are messy. To avoid my previous mistakes, I define that folders are not notes, nor notes are folders; since both of them have their own purpose that it shouldn't mix with each other, such as the so-called “folder notes”, otherwise, their purpose is confused and the folder's hierarchy will not be rather circular, defeating its own usefulness. As such, folder is the group of one kind of notes that separates from another kind of notes, but can be correlated through the content, but their kind is still different; for example, if we think of a biological taxonomy, we would group dogs and humans as a mammal, while the ducks, as it is not part of the mammal, is another kind (that we call it as 'bird'), we can still relate one to the other.


To give you a quick insight of the root structure, I will point that:
- `content` is the main content vault.
	- `about` is related to my personal opinions.
	- `assets` is the storage of local images.
	- `blog` is just blog.
	- `knowledge` is the result of my whole philosophical investigation.
		- `episteme` is the knowledge of science, philosophy, and art.
		- `mathema` is the knowledge of maths.
		- `techne` is the knowledge of technology.
	- `life management` is to manage my present life.
		- `config` is to keep my configuration as non-forgetful.
		- `kanban` is just markdown viewed in kanban.
		- `time` is for decision-making.
- `docs` is for publishing documentation using MkDocs.
- `FleetingNotesApp` is for taking notes instantly by using Fleeting Notes.
- `overrides`, currently hidden, is for overriding HTML in MkDocs.

## Tags

I tag notes based on which…
- language I'm using [^1] (whether is English, Spanish, Catalan, or my conlang Latina).
- inquiry relates (whether is science, philosophy, or art).
- branch relates.
