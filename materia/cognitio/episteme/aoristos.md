> It's the undefined aspect. It's not meant to really show details about how the action took place. You mentioned it being “confusing” but a better word is that it's intentionally “vague” since the details of how it's done doesn't matter to the author. Btw, think more along the lines of aspect instead of tense when it comes to Greek verb aspects (tenses).

> The word comes from Ancient Greek ἀόριστος (aóristos 'indefinite'), as the aorist was the unmarked (default) form of the verb, and thus did not have the implications of the imperfective aspect, which referred to an ongoing or repeated situation, or the perfect, which referred to a situation with a continuing relevance; instead it described an action “pure and simple”.

> In that language, the main feature of the aorist is that it is a tense with indeterminate aspect, in contrast to the present and imperfect tenses of that language which are generally understood to be continuous aspect. In this respect, it looks at the action as a “snapshot” rather than as a “motion picture” (Wallace 1996). 
> The aorist is usually not considered with time, but in the indicative mood and in participles, it generally describes past action.  
> Straightforward translations of the aorist into English is usually by way of the past tense.
