# First Brain vs Second Brain
The first brain is our actual brain, which, as long as we are alive, is constantly working, performing tasks such as knowledge management, task management, goal management, and more. Most of the time, we can't multitask effectively, so the first brain is more like a CPU, with various types of tasks competing for CPU cycles. When there are too many tasks to handle, the brain becomes overwhelmed because it has to process current tasks while maintaining the context for other tasks for switching between them. This makes it hard for us to focus on executing the current task, and at that point, we need an external system to assist the first brain. This is where the second brain comes in.

The second brain is an external system. If the first brain is likened to a CPU, then the second brain is more like a storage system. It serves as a cache between the first brain and the real world, reducing the first brain's load and allowing it to focus on the current task. It can be compared to memory and hard disk, except that memory communicates with the CPU (first brain) more frequently and with faster read speeds. This storage system holds the things that the first brain does not need to be constantly aware of. Of course, these things must be deliberated by the first brain to decide whether they are worth storing, and the content can be records, to-dos, processes, with the medium being text, images, videos.

For example, when using a second brain for task management, we store important and urgent tasks in memory and less important, not urgent ones on the hard disk; this week's tasks in memory, and this month's tasks probably on the hard disk. Thus, by leveraging the second brain, we can focus on the present without stress and switch contexts when necessary.

This article will use Obsidian as an example to share my practice in building a second brain! You can call it a second brain, but from different perspectives, I can also call it "LifeOS," because I record everything on it, living and working; I can also call it "Programmable Personal Productivity System," I've written a lot of code on it for querying and automation, and itâ€™s also the productivity system I use to manage tasks and goals; it even resembles a "Monorepo Project," where each folder is a project, and the README.md in each project describes the current project's meta-information like a Package.json.

See the [[CODE Model]] and [[PARA Method]].
