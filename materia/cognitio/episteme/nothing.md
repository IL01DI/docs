>>From nothing, nothing comes (ex nihilo, nihil fit)

>\- Widely accepted by Greek philosophers, though commonly attributed to Parmenides. ([Wikipedia EN, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_materia))
>1. The belief of the `arkhe` must accept this notion and deny most cosmogonical myths, hence Parmenides found a fundamental idea and criticized past philosophers for their diverse ideas related to it.

>[!quote] _On the non being_
>>Nothing is.

>>Things that are not must somehow be

> 1. The sophists can say and think about nothing, or non-being, in order to present and teach false knowledge to the others.
> 2. As such, it is deniable the Eleatic idea of "nothing comes from nothing" since the sophists can pass non-being into being.
> 3. Thus, it suggests non-being is, instead of non-being is not.
> 4. While Parmenides adverts us that "it is impossible that things that are not are", he identified only rest equals as is.[^1]
> 5. Therefore, one must accept both rest and change equals as is, hence what is not is.
> 6. Since Parmenides' definition of non-being is no longer useful, it is necessary to say that:
>   1. Being is a kind that shares all things that are in common.
>   2. Identity is a kind that all things belongs in a same kind with particular attributes.
>   3. Difference is a kind that things of a kind differs from another kind each other.
>   - Non-being is not the opposite of being, but the negation of being. In other words, non-being is different from being, so non-being is difference.
> 7. It is possible now that true and false statements are distinguished each other.[^2]
> 8. Each statement must have a subject, the name, and a predicative, the verb.
> 9. Therefore, since a statement always contains a subject, the speech and though cannot be about nothing.
> 10. As for the verb, while it states a property of a subject, the statement will be true; otherwise, it will be false, instead of assuming it as non-being.
> 11. To conclude, the sophist is able to imitate as a wise man and produce images and appearances.

> - When there is a thing, there is also a nothing. Not because a thing is, and nothing is not; but because the thing is the one, and nothing is the other.
> - For example: if there is a fire, there is also a non-fire; the one I see is a fire, but what I see that fire outside is the non-fire, like me, like you.

[^1]: This idea is problematic for the above results.
[^2]: Since Parmenides stated that false is not and cannot be conceived, all statements will always be true, and there is, as such, no opinion at all, even himself had spoken about its ridiculous existence for the mankind.
