The CODE model was proposed by time-management coach Tiago Forte in "Building a Second Brain" and stands for four steps: Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express.

CODE represents four core steps:
- Capture
- Organize
- Distill
- Express

Here is an overview of each step of the CODE model:

# Capture
This step refers to the process of seizing inspiration and information. When you receive any information or idea, you should record it quickly for subsequent processing. The purpose of capture is to reduce the memory burden on the brain.

# Organize
After capture, the next step is to systematically organize the information. By classifying, sorting, and archiving, you can ensure that each piece of information is saved in an easily retrievable place. The specific practice is the well-known PARA organization method.

# Distill
The distillation process involves summarizing and condensing information, retaining only the most valuable insights and data. This usually means simplifying information to the core points for quick digestion and review.

# Express
The final step is transforming your thoughts and learning into an external form, such as writing, teaching, or creating some form of work. By expressing, you not only integrate and consolidate your knowledge, but you can also share with others and receive feedback.

Tiago Forte's underlying idea is that by externalizing and appropriately managing your knowledge, you can use information more efficiently, create value, and improve personal and professional efficiency. This model is particularly suitable for today's information overload digital age, emphasizing not only the collection of information but also the active processing and utilization of this information.
