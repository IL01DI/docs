~~As stated in the official [OpenAI article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936830-what-happens-after-i-use-my-free-tokens-or-the-3-months-is-up-in-the-free-trial)~~:[^1]

> To explore and experiment with the API, all new users get $5 worth of free tokens. These tokens expire after 3 months.
> 
> After the quota has passed you can choose to enter [billing information](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing) to upgrade to a paid plan and continue your use of the API on pay-as-you-go basis. If no billing information is entered you will still have login access, but will be unable to make any further API requests.
> 
> Please see the [pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) page for the latest information on pay-as-you-go pricing.

[^1]:The article is no longer available and OpenAI does not offer any reset token for free accounts. Therefore, I can't use OpenAI API for now.
