# Origin and evolution of the life
## Spontaneous generation
### The rise of the spontaneous generation
For centuries, people based their beliefs on their interpretations of what they saw going on in the world around them without testing their ideas to determine the validity of these theories — in other words, they didn't use the **scientific method** to arrive at answers to their questions. Rather, their conclusions were based on untested observations.[^1]

Among these ideas, for centuries, since at least the time of Aristotle (4th Century BC), people (including scientists) believed that simple living organisms could come into being by spontaneous generation. This was the idea that non-living objects can give rise to living organisms. It was common “knowledge” that simple organisms like worms, beetles, frogs, and salamanders could come from dust, mud, etc., and food left out, quickly “swarmed” with life:[^1]

> > In the cities, there were no sewers, no garbage trucks, no electricity, and no refrigeration. Sewage flowed in the gutters along the streets, and the sidewalks were raised above the streets to give people a place to walk. In the intersections, raised stepping stones were strategically placed to allow pedestrians to cross the intersection, yet were spaced such that carriage wheels could pass between them. In the morning, the contents of the chamber pots were tossed out the nearest window. Food was purchased and prepared on a daily basis, and when people were done eating a meal, the bones and left-overs were tossed out the window, too. A chivalrous gentleman always walked closest to the street when escorting a woman, so if a horse and carriage came by and splashed up the filth flowing in the gutters, it would land on him, and not the lady's expensive silk gown (many of these gowns were so ornately embroidered that they were not easily washable, and neither washing machines nor dry cleaners existed). Many cities also had major rat problems. People back then may or may not have not connected the presence of rats with the spread of Bubonic Plague (Black Death, a dreaded and fatal disease), but they were probably bothered by the rats chewing on things and by the rat fleas biting them (just as cat/dog owners, even now, are bitten by the offspring of their pet's fleas). People may not have realized that the Plague was spread by the bites of those fleas, but I imagine they knew that if only they could get rid of the rats, the pesky fleas would soon disappear, too — hence the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Germany, leading all the rats out of town.

#### Pre-Socratic philosophers
The first western thinker to propose that life developed spontaneously from non-living matter was likely Anaximander. According to Hippolytus of Rome in the third century CE, Anaximander claimed that fish or fish-like creatures were first formed in the “wet” when acted on by the heat of the sun and that these aquatic creatures gave rise to human beings. Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century, reported:[^2]
> Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.

Anaximenes thought that air was the element that imparted life and endowed creatures with motion and thought. He proposed that plants and animals, including human beings, arose from a primordial terrestrial slime, a mixture of earth and water, combined with the sun's heat. Anaxagoras, too, believed that life emerged from a terrestrial slime. However, Anaximenes held that the seeds of plants existed in the air from the beginning, and those of animals in the aether. While Xenophanes traced the origin of man back to the transitional period between the fluid stage of the Earth and the formation of land, under the influence of the Sun. Empedocles accepted the spontaneous generation of life, but held that different forms, made up of differing combinations of parts, spontaneously arose as though by trial and error: successful combinations formed the individuals present in the observer's lifetime, whereas unsuccessful forms failed to reproduce.[^2]
#### Aristotle

> [!tldr]- TL;DR
> Aristotle was one of the earliest recorded scholars to articulate the theory of spontaneous generation, the notion that life can arise from non-living matter. Aristotle proposed that life arose from non-living material if the material contained _pneuma_ {“vital heat”}. As evidence, he noted several instances of the appearance of animals from environments previously devoid of such animals, such as the seemingly sudden appearance of fish in a new puddle of water.[^3]

In is biological work, Aristotle theorized extensively the reproduction of various animals, whether by sexual, parthenogenetic, or spontaneous generation.  In accordance with his fundamental theory of hylomorphism, Aristotle's basic theory of sexual reproduction contended that the male's seed imposed form, the set of characteristics passed down to offspring on the “matter” {menstrual blood} supplied by the female. Thus, female matter is the materie cause of generation—it supplies the matter that will constitute the offspring—while the male semen is the efficient cause, the factor that instigates and delineates the thing's existence. Yet, Aristotle proposed in the History of Animals, many creatures form not through sexual processes but by spontaneous generation:^3
> Now there is one property that animals are found to have in common with plants. For some plants are generated from the seed of plants, whilst other plants are self-generated through the formation of some elemental principle similar to a seed; and of these latter plants some derive their nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow inside other plants … So with animals, some spring from parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow spontaneously and not from kindred stock; and of these instances of spontaneous generation some come from putrefying earth or vegetable matter, as is the case with a number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their several organs.

\- Aristotle, _History of Animals_, Book V, Part 1

According to this theory, living things may come forth from non-living things in a manner roughly analogous to the “enformation of the female matter by the agency of the male seed” seen in sexual reproduction. Non-living materials, like the seminal fluid present in sexual generation, contain _[pneuma]_ “breath”, or “vital heat”. According to Aristotle, _pneuma_ had more “heat” than regular air did, and this heat endowed the substance with certain vital properties:[^2]
> The power of every soul seems to have shared in a different and more divine body than the so called (four) elements… For every (animal), what makes the seed generative inheres in the seed and is called its “heat”. But this is not fire or some such power, but instead the _pneuma_ that is enclosed in the seed and in foamy matter, this being analogous to the element of the stars. This is why fire does not generate any animal… but the heat of the sun and the heat of animals does, not only the heat that fills the seed, but also any other residue of (the animal's) nature that may exist similarly possesses this vital principle.

\- Aristotle, _Generation of Animals_, 736b29ff

Aristotle drew an analogy between the “foamy matter” found in nature and the “seed” of an animal, which he viewed as being a kind of foam itself (composed, as it were, from a mixture of water and _pneuma_). For Aristotle, the generative materials of male and female animals (semen and menstrual fluid) were essentially refinements, made by male and female bodies according to their respective proportions of heat, of ingested food, which was, in turn, a by-product of the elements earth and water. Thus, any creature, whether generated sexually from parents or spontaneously through the interaction of vital heat and elemental matter, was dependent on the proportions of _pneuma_ and the various elements which Aristotle believed comprised all things. While Aristotle recognized that many living things emerged from putrefying matter, he pointed out that the putrefaction was not the source of life, but the by-product of the action of the “sweet” element of water.[^2]
> Animals and plants come into being in earth and in liquid because there is water in earth, and air in water, and in all air is vital heat, so that in a sense all things are full of soul. Therefore, living things form quickly whenever this air and vital heat are enclosed in anything. When they are so enclosed, the corporeal liquids being heated, there arises as it were a frothy bubble.[^2] Whether what is forming is to be more or less honourable in kind depends on the embracing of the physical principle; this again depends on the medium in which the generation takes place and the material which is included.[^4]

\- Aristotle, _Generation of Animals_, Book III, Part 11[^2]

With varying degrees of observational confidence, Aristotle theorized the spontaneous generation of a range of creatures from different sorts of inanimate matter. The _testaceans_ (a genus which for Aristotle included bivalves and snails), for instance, were characterized by spontaneous generation from mud, but differed based upon the precise material they grew in—for example, clams and scallops in sand, oysters in slime, and the barnacle and the limpet in the hollows of rocks.[^2]
#### Latin and early Christian sources
Athenaeus dissented towards spontaneous generation, claiming that a variety of anchovy did not generate from roe, as Aristotle stated, but rather, from sea foam.[^2]
As the dominant view of philosophers and thinkers continued to be in favour of spontaneous generation, some Christian theologians accepted the view. Augustine of Hippo discussed spontaneous generation in _The City of God_ and _The Literal Meaning of Genesis_, citing Biblical passages such as “Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life” [Genesis 1:20] as decrees that would enable ongoing creation.[^2]
### The end of the idea of the spontaneous generation
The belief that life could arise by spontaneous generation from the inert material have been very extended until the `XIX` century. The deficient technics of observation would seem to confirm cases of spontaneous generation like, for example, that the frog appeared from the rain, or the worms from the meat.
The first scientific experience against this idea carried out by the Italian medic Francesco Redi in 1668. Redi prepared jars with meat, a few uncovered, but only in those that are opened appeared worms [larvas of fly]. Redi observed that the flies entered and left from the opened jars and concluded that, if the flies do not have access to the meat, in there would not appear worms. Nevertheless, his observations are not enough to reject the idea of the spontaneous generation.
Almost one century more late, the discovery of the microorganisms reactivated the idea of the spontaneous generation. Thus, in 1748 the English Jesuit John Needham boiled meat broth and placed in closed bottles with cork. After a few days he checked that in all the bottles proliferated the microorganisms and interpreted as a confirmation of the spontaneous generation.
However, his work method has been criticized by an Italian abbé, Lazzaro Spallanzani, who, in 1767, repeated the experiences of Needham introducing some modifications. Closed hermetically, with heat, the neck of some glass bottles that contained the broth and later maintained in water boiling during a few minutes. After a few days he checked that would not have trails of microorganism in the closed bottles and that, however, proliferated in those that remained opened. The experiments of Spallanzani were been criticized by the more recalcitrant supporters of the spontaneous generation.
It was the French scientist Louis Pasteur who, in 1861, with a series of experiments, managed to surpass the objection of the air absence and banish definitely the idea of the spontaneous generation.
## The origin of the life
### The prebiotic synthesis
After the (convincing, conclusive, overwhelming) experiences of Pasteur, the problem about the origin of the life took more than sixty years to be addressed newly. In the decade of 1920, the Russian biochemistry Alexander I. Oparin and the Britain geneticist J. B. S. Haldane conceive, independently, one revolutionary proposal; one “new version” of the spontaneous generation but applicable, just, at the beginning of the life. According to Oparin and Haldane, the life would be the result of a gradual process that comprised three stage. The two first stages constitute the denominated prebiotic synthesis:
- Formation of simple organic molecule. The components of the primitive atmosphere, exposed to the high solar radiations and to the electric discharges, would react to originate organic molecule like the amino-acids.
- Formation of complex organic molecule. The simple organic molecules would combine to form other more complex molecules, that would go accumulate in the primitive ocean, giving place to the “primordial soup”.
- Coacervate formation. Some of the compound of the primordial soup would unite, originating the empty spheres or coacervates. Inside those coacervates would be closed molecules, like the nucleic acids, that could prepare copies of itself. They would be, in consequence, the precursors of the first organisms.
### The experimental simulation of Miller
The hipothesis of Oparin-Haldane received a strong support in 1953 thanks to the experience done by Stanley Miller, in which reproduced in the laboratory the conditions that supposedly would give in the primitive Earth and managed to formate simple organic compounds.

> [!info]
> 1. In his experiment, Miller designed a circuit in which the initial point was a recipient with water placed to boil. Thus, the formed vapour went sweeping along the compounds that found throughout the conduits.
> 2. In a glass recipient, he introduced the gasses that, according to Oparin, formed the primitive atmosphere.
> 3. He subjected the gasses to electric discharges, doing to pass later to the cold tube for condensing them, recollecting them in a recipient that represents the primitive ocean.
> 4. After a week, it would have now the amino-acids and other simple organic compounds in that “primitive ocean”

Nor the experiment of Miller nor others subsequent were managed to synthesize all the compounds of the living beings, nor more or less explain the origin of the life.
Nevertheless, the innegable conclusion that those led to is that at least the prime materia for the life could have generated spontaneously.
### The reinterpretation of the prebiotic synthesis
All the organisms present a huge uniformity, both structural and functional. These likenesses supposed a proof, generally admitted, of a common origin to the forms of life.
The majority of the actual hypothesis about the origin of the life starts at the existence of biomolecules as requisite for the appearance of the first organisms. However, for the new discoveries came up critiques to the initial ideas about the prebiotic synthesis:
- A primitive atmosphere not so reductive. The principal critique was born from the new datums about the composition of the primitive atmosphere, but reductive that Miller supposed. If its experiment repeats with mixed gasses less reductive, the results obtain worse, but the theory about the primordial soup yet remains numerous adepts.
- A “soup” too much diluted. The condensation of monomers to form polymers does not produce in a diluted environment, just like the hypothesis of Oparin-Haldane propose for the soup of the primitive ocean. Is it possible that the temperature of the primitive Earth were too high to allow the existence of ocean? In that case, stages of torrential rains would succeed, in which follows a fast evaporation that would concentrate the organic molecules in the scarce humidity.  The capacity of adsorption of the clays would favour its concentration and its transformation in polymers.
### Hydrothermal sources instead of primitive soup
In front of the atmosphere-ocean system of Oparin-Haldane, some scientists suggest as alternative the hypothesis of the submarine hydrothermal sources. In these sources, resulted by the volcanic activity, the warm water sweep along in its exit a huge quantity of mineral substances that react in an environment wanting of oxygen.
Actually in these ecosystems proliferate the organisms, especially the microorganisms considered more primitives, like the thermophilic prokaryotes, capable of living in temperatures beyond 100 °C.
In spite of many conjectures and interest experiences, it cannot forget yet that it has not managed to fabricate life in a laboratory. Between the prebiotic synthesis and the first organism, it continues to exist a huge vacuum.
## What is biodiversity?
### Compounds of the biodiversity
The term biodiversity was coined by Edward O. Wilson in 1985 to refer to the biologic diversity and encompass conceptually all the variety of the life.

> [!info]
> The biodiversity is the variety of all the types and forms of life, from the genes to the species, in an ample scale of ecosystems.

The idea that closes this term is important and complex, as it is the life itself, but, in it, remains implicit that in the biodiversity exists three compounds or principal levels: diversity of genes, diversity of species and diversity of ecosystems.

| Genetic diversity | Specific diversity | Ecological diversity |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------|

|The genetic diversity is the variability that exists in the genetic information of the individuals of the same specie. It can measure utilizing the diversity of genes, heterozygosity, or the number of allele per locus.|The specific diversity is the concept most used, and refers to the variety of species (or the most ample taxonomical group, like class or kingdom) that exists in a region, or in all the biosphere.|The ecological diversity is the variety of biological communities that interacts between itself and with its non-living environments. This is the most dificult to define and measure because the ecosystems does not have closed border.|

> [!info]
> In 1962, an abnormal station of rains in the crater of the Ngorongoro (Tanzania) favoured the development of a plague of biter flies (_Stomoxys calcitrans_) that reduced to 15 individuals the population of lions of Ngorongoro, formed by a few one hundred individuals, that presents grave reproductive problems and of survival.

~~### Rate to measure the biodiversity~~
## The origin of the biodiversity: evolutive theories
### Antiquity
#### Ancient Greeks
Proposals that one type of animal, could descend from other types of animals, are known to go back to the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers.[^5]

##### Pre-Socratic philosophers
Anaximander of Miletus proposed that the first animals lived in water, during a wet phase of the Earth's past, and that the first land-dwelling ancestors of mankind must have been born in water, and only spent part of their life on land. He also argued that the first human of the form known today must have been the child of a different type of animal (probably a fish), because man needs prolonged nursing to live.[^5]

Empedocles argued that what we call birth and death in animals are just the mingling and separations of elements, which cause the countless “tribes of mortal things”. Specifically, the first animals and plants were like disjointed parts of the ones we see today, some of which survived by joining in different combinations, and then intermixing during the development of the embryo, and where “everything turned out as it would have if it were on purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way”.[^5]

> [!info]
> The reflections of Empedocles and the views of the Greek Atomists among the pre-Socratic nature philosophers constituted a Classical heritage on which later speculations could be developed. These pre-Socratic speculations combined naturalistic myths of origins with reflections on the workings of chance-like processes to create a naturalistic account of the origins of existing forms of life. Particularly as the pre-Socratic Atomist speculations were restated by Titus Lucretius in book five of his _On the Nature of Things_ (Lucretius [RN]), a source was available in Antiquity that set out a speculative account of the gradual origin of living beings from an initial atomic chaos through an undirected process that sorts out the best adapted forms and eliminates those not suited to their conditions.[^6]

> [!tldr]- TL;DR
> Other philosophers who became more influential at that time, including Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, believed that the types of all things, not only living things, were fixed by divine design; opposed to the speculative accounts of the early atomists.[^5]

##### Plato
According to Ernst Mayr, Plato was “the great anti-hero of evolutionism,” because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is also referred to as the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or “species” which defines that type.[^5]

> [!example]-
> In his _Timaeus_, providing an influential non-Biblical source for arguments against the Atomist tradition[^6], Plato has a character to tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, “… free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be”. The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since “… without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, if it is to be perfect".[^5]
> > [!info]
> > This dialogue serves as the _locus classicus_ for the notion of an externally-imposed origin of living beings through the action of an intelligent Craftsman {_demiurgos_} who orders a mathematically-conceived matter into a rational cosmos that includes living beings in accord with eternal archetypes or forms, realizing through this activity both aesthetic and rational ends.[^6]

Plato’s account initiated the long tradition of reflection that was continued in Neoplatonism and in aspects of Stoicism to form the foundation of the argument that organic beings could not be explained by chance-like processes either in their origins or in their complex design. Particularly as developed in the influential writings of Claudius Galenus, a long heritage in the life sciences relied upon anatomy as evidence of rational design. These interpretations of “teleological design” interacted in complex ways with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Biblical concepts of creation.[^6]

> [!Info]
> One common meaning of “teleology” frequently encountered in discussions of evolution since Darwin—that of externally imposed design by an intelligent agency {demiurge, nature, God} on pre-existing matter— originates in these ancient discussions and is not accurately identified with the Biblical concept of _creatio ex nihilo_.

##### Aristotle
In Aristotle’s seminal biological writings, (resulted from his research into natural history on and around the island of Lesbos and have survived in the form of four books: _On the Soul_, _History of Animals_, _Generation of Animals_, and _On the Parts of Animals_[^5]) the external teleology of a designer-creator was replaced by an internal teleological purposiveness associated with the immanent action of an internal cause—in living beings their informing soul {_psuche_}—which functioned as the formal, final and efficient cause of life [Aristotle, _De Anima_ II: 415b, 10–30]. Aristotle also did not endorse the concept of an historical origin of the world, affirming instead the eternity of the world order [_Physics_, I: 192a, 25–34]. At least, this was how he was understood by a later tradition.^2

Another issue that Aristotle treated extensively with relevance to the conception of species—embryogenesis—also had important implications for later discussions. In the traditions indebted in some way to Aristotle’s natural philosophy, sexual generation and the subsequent embryological development of the individual from primordial matter, is a sequential process that occurs in time under the teleological action of the soul {_psuche_}. In Aristotle’s own account, this soul-as-form is typically derived from the male parent, but it could also be derived even from the sun, as employed in his explanation of the origin of spontaneously-generated forms [Aristotle, _De generatione animalium_, III: 762a, 20–35].[^6]

This theory of the passing on of soul-as-substantial form in generation also formed the basis of one meaning of “species” {_eidos_} in Aristotle’s biological works—as the individualized enmattered form-as-soul that is perpetuated in generation eternally. Although connected by a complex theory of mental abstraction to the universal in thought and language, a “species” in this biological sense is not a universal, but an eternal serial sequence of one individual generating another individual [_De Anima_, II: 415b, 1–10]. One interpretive issue in the exegesis of Aristotle’s conception of species concerns the degree to which he was committed to asserting anything beyond the eternity of the three main groups {_gene_}—plants, animals and humans—rather than the eternity of each individual kind {_eidos_} [_De generatione animalium_, II: 731b, 32–732a5].[^6]

According to Charles Singer, “Nothing is more remarkable than (Aristotle's) efforts to (exhibit) the relationships of living things as a _scala naturae_”. This _scala naturae_, described in _Historia animalium_, classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical but static “Ladder of Life” or “great chain of being,” placing them according to their complexity of structure and function, with organisms that showed greater vitality and ability to move described as “higher organisms”. Aristotle believed that features of living organisms showed clearly that they had what he called a final cause, that is to say that their form suited their function. He explicitly rejected the view of Empedocles that living creatures might have originated by chance.[^5]
##### Zeno of Citium
Cicero wrote that Zeno was known to have held the view, central to Stoic physics, that nature is primarily “directed and concentrated…to secure for the world…the structure best fitted for survival.”[^5]
#### Chinese
Ancient Chinese thinkers such as Zhuang Zhou expressed ideas on changing biological species. According to Joseph Needham, Taoism explicitly denies the fixity of biological species and Taoist philosophers speculated that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments. Taoism regards humans, nature, and the heavens as existing in a state of “constant transformation” known as the _Tao_, in contrast with the more static view of nature typical of Western thought[^5]
#### Ancient Rome
##### Lucretius
Lucretius' poem _De rerum natura_ provides the best surviving explanation of the ideas of the Greek Epicurean philosophers. It describes the development of the cosmos, the Earth, living things, and human society through purely naturalistic mechanisms, without any reference to supernatural involvement. _De rerum natura_ would influence the cosmological and evolutionary speculations of philosophers and scientists during and after the Renaissance. This view was in strong contrast with the views of Roman philosophers of the Stoic school such as Seneca the Younger, and Pliny the Elder, who had a strongly teleological view of the natural world that influenced Christian theology. Cicero reports that the peripatetic and Stoic view of nature as an agency concerned most basically with producing life “best fitted for survival” was taken for granted among the Hellenistic elite.[^5]
##### Early Church Fathers
###### Origen of Alexandria
In line with earlier Greek thought, Origen of Alexandria argued that the creation story in the Book of Genesis should be interpreted as an allegory for the falling of human souls away from the glory of the divine, and not as a literal, historical account:
> For who that has understanding will suppose that the first, and second, and third day, and the evening and the morning, existed without a sun, and moon, and stars? And that the first day was, as it were, also without a sky? And who is so foolish as to suppose that God, after the manner of a husbandman, planted a paradise in Eden, towards the east, and placed in it a tree of life, visible and palpable, so that one tasting of the fruit by the bodily teeth obtained life? And again, that one was a partaker of good and evil by masticating what was taken from the tree? And if God is said to walk in the paradise in the evening, and Adam to hide himself under a tree, I do not suppose that anyone doubts that these things figuratively indicate certain mysteries, the history having taken place in appearance, and not literally.

\- Origen, _On the First Principles_ IV.16[^5]
###### Gregory of Nyssa
> Scripture informs us that the Deity **proceeded by a sort of graduated and ordered advance to the creation of man**. After the foundations of the universe were laid, as the history records, man did not appear on the earth at once, but the creation of the brutes preceded him, and the plants preceded them. Thereby Scripture shows that the vital forces blended with the world of matter according to a gradation; first it infused itself into insensate nature; and in continuation of this advanced into the sentient world; and then ascended to intelligent and rational beings.[^5]

Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote in his work on the history of evolutionary thought, _From the Greeks to Darwin_:
> Among the Christian Fathers the movement towards a partly naturalistic interpretation of the order of Creation was made by Gregory of Nyssa in the fourth century, and was completed by Augustine in the fourth and fifth centuries. …(Gregory of Nyssa) taught that Creation was potential. God imparted to matter its fundamental properties and laws. The objects and completed forms of the Universe developed gradually out of chaotic material.[^5]
###### Augustine of Hippo
In the fourth century AD, Augustine of Hippo followed Origen in arguing that the Genesis creation story should be read allegorically. In his book he prefaces saying:
> In all sacred books, we should consider the eternal truths that are taught, the facts that are narrated, the future events that are predicted, and the precepts or counsels that are given. In the case of a narrative of events, the question arises whether everything must be taken according to the figurative sense only, or whether it must be expounded and defended also as a faithful record of what happened. No Christian would dare say that the narrative must not be taken in a figurative sense. For St. Paul says: _Now all these things that happened to them were symbolic._ [1 Cor 10:11] And he explains the statement in Genesis, _And they shall be two in one flesh_, as a great mystery in reference to Christ and to the Church. [Eph 5:32]

\- Augustine, _On the Literal Meaning of Genesis_[^5]
Later he differentiates between the days of the Genesis 1 creation narrative and 24-hour days:[^5]
> But at least we know [the days of creation] are different from the ordinary day of which we are familiar.

He also talks about a form of theistic evolution:[^5]
> The things [God] had potentially created… [came] forth in the course of time on different days according to their different kinds… [and] the rest of the earth [was] filled with its various kinds of creatures, [which] produced their appropriate forms in due time.

Which has led Francis Collins of Biologos to believe Augustine espoused a form of theistic evolution. Augustine's idea “that forms of life had been transformed 'slowly over time'” prompted Father Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti to claim that Augustine had suggested a form of evolution. Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote in From the Greeks to Darwin (1894):[^5]
> If the orthodoxy of Augustine had remained the teaching of the Church, the final establishment of Evolution would have come far earlier than it did, certainly during the eighteenth instead of the nineteenth century, and the bitter controversy over this truth of Nature would never have arisen. … Plainly as the direct or instantaneous Creation of animals and plants appeared to be taught in Genesis, Augustine read this in the light of primary causation and the gradual development from the imperfect to the perfect of Aristotle. This most influential teacher thus handed down to his followers opinions which closely conform to the progressive views of those theologians of the present day who have accepted the Evolution theory.

In _A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom_ [1896], Andrew Dickson White wrote about Augustine's attempts to preserve the ancient evolutionary approach to the creation as follows:[^5]
> For ages a widely accepted doctrine had been that water, filth, and carrion had received power from the Creator to generate worms, insects, and a multitude of the smaller animals; and this doctrine had been especially welcomed by St. Augustine and many of the fathers, since it relieved the Almighty of making, Adam of naming, and Noah of living in the ark with these innumerable despised species.

In Augustine's _De Genesi contra Manichæos_, on Genesis, he says: “To suppose that God formed man from the dust with bodily hands is very childish. … God neither formed man with bodily hands nor did he breathe upon him with throat and lips.” Augustine suggests in other work his theory of the later development of insects out of carrion, and the adoption of the old emanation or evolution theory, showing that “certain very small animals may not have been created on the fifth and sixth days, but may have originated later from putrefying matter.” Concerning Augustine's _On the Trinity_, White wrote that Augustine “…develops at length the view that in the creation of living beings there was something like a growth—that God is the ultimate author, but works through secondary causes; and finally argues that certain substances are endowed by God with the power of producing certain classes of plants and animals.”[^5]

> Augustine believed, that whatever science shows us the Bible must teach since the Bible is infallible:[^5]
> > Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the star… Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.

### Middle Ages
Although Greek and Roman evolutionary ideas died out in Western Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, they were not lost to Islamic philosophers and scientists (nor to the culturally Greek Byzantine Empire). In the Islamic Golden Age of the 8th to the 13th centuries, philosophers explored ideas about natural history. These ideas included transmutation from non-living to living:[^5]
> from mineral to plant, from plant to animal, and from animal to man.

> [!Abstract]-
> The implications of Aristotle’s complex thought for subsequent discussions of species, generated by the recovery of his writings in the Latin West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were varied. On one hand, Aristotle’s apparent metaphysical requirement that the soul-as-form [_eidos_] be permanent and enduring through the process of the generation of “like by like” seemed for much of the tradition to amount to a denial of the possibility that natural species could change over time in their essential properties, even though local adaptation in “accidental” properties was fully possible. Since individual beings were considered to be dynamic composites of a material substrate and an immaterial and eternal form, the accidental differentiation of the substantial form in individuals did not affect the metaphysical endurance of the species. It also made species extinction metaphysically impossible. In living beings, the soul-as-form is serially passed on through time in the act of generation to create an eternal continuity of the form. This supplied a metaphysical foundation for the notion of species permanence without reliance on an external creative agency.[^6]

In the background of the discussion of the high Middle Ages was also the theory of divine creation endorsed in inherited Jewish, Christian and Islamic thought. This required a distinction between the first origin of species in historical time, and the normal generation of the individual. If the origin of species was attributed to divine action, the temporal emergence of these species was not necessarily instantaneous. Such a doctrine was the basis of Augustine of Hippo’s theory of the original creation of primordial seeds [_rationes seminales_] of each species at an original moment in time, but with the emergence of species in historical time a possibility [Augustine, VI.13.23–25, [GL, 175–76]]. This theory of a temporalized creation, put forth explicitly in detail in his treatise _The Literal Interpretation of Genesis_, allowed Augustine to argue that species emerged sequentially in historical time rather than all at once.[^6]
The great textual recoveries in the Latin West of Greek science, medicine and philosophy of the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, generally accompanied by Islamic commentaries, introduced these texts into a theological context that had been strongly defined by Augustinianism and neo-Platonism. The interplay between this pre-existent tradition with new philosophical views defined a complex period of intellectual ferment that defined much of the subsequent intellectual and scientific history of the West.[^6]
#### Islamic philosophy
In the medieval Islamic world, al-Jāḥiẓ wrote his _Book of Animals_ in the 9th century. Conway Zirkle, writing about the history of natural selection in 1941, said that an excerpt from this work was the only relevant passage he had found from an Arabian scholar. He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence, citing a Spanish translation of this work: "Every weak animal devours those weaker than itself. Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by other animals stronger than they. And in this respect, men do not differ from animals, some with respect to others, although they do not arrive at the same extremes. In short, God has disposed some human beings as a cause of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of the death of the former". Al-Jāḥiẓ also wrote descriptions of food chains.[^5]
In 1377, Ibn Khaldūn wrote the _Muqaddimah_ in which he asserted that humans developed from "the world of the monkeys," in a process by which "species become more numerous". In chapter 1 he writes:[^5]
> This world with all the created things in it has a certain order and solid construction. It shows nexuses between causes and things caused, combinations of some parts of creation with others, and transformations of some existent things into others, in a pattern that is both remarkable and endless.

The _Muqaddimah_ also states in chapter 6:[^5]
> We explained there that the whole of existence in (all) its simple and composite worlds is arranged in a natural order of ascent and descent, so that everything constitutes an uninterrupted continuum. The essences at the end of each particular stage of the worlds are by nature prepared to be transformed into the essence adjacent to them, either above or below them. This is the case with the simple material elements; it is the case with palms and vines, (which constitute) the last stage of plants, in their relation to snails and shellfish, (which constitute) the (lowest) stage of animals. It is also the case with monkeys, creatures combining in themselves cleverness and perception, in their relation to man, the being who has the ability to think and to reflect. The preparedness (for transformation) that exists on either side, at each stage of the worlds, is meant when (we speak about) their connection.
#### The Scholastic
While most Christian theologians held that the natural world was part of an unchanging designed hierarchy,[^5] the sustained efforts of major synthesizers, such as Thomas Aquinas,[^6] speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes and,[^5] to bring the massive body of newly-recovered Aristotelian works into dialogue with Christian Neoplatonism and Augustinianism, demanded new insights into the conception of the soul-body relation, the autonomy of the natural order and the role of secondary causes in the creation of the world.[^6] Thus, Thomas Aquinas expounded on Augustine of Hippo's early idea of theistic evolution:[^5]
> On the day on which God created the heaven and the earth, He created also every plant of the field, not, indeed, actually, but 'before it sprung up in the earth,' that is, potentially... All things were not distinguished and adorned together, not from a want of power on God's part, as requiring time in which to work, but that due order might be observed in the instituting of the world.On the day on which God created the heaven and the earth, He created also every plant of the field, not, indeed, actually, but 'before it sprung up in the earth,' that is, potentially... All things were not distinguished and adorned together, not from a want of power on God's part, as requiring time in which to work, but that due order might be observed in the instituting of the world.

He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that:[^5]
> Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to take the form of a ship.

Concerning the issue of species-permanence and origin, Aquinas treated this in dialogue with Augustine’s theory of serial creation. As he comments in his major synthesis, the _Summa Theologiae_: “New species, if they appear, pre-exist in certain active powers” (Pars I, Qu. 73, Rep Obj. 3). This claim suggests a reading of Aristotle that assumed the essential fixity of each definable substantial form, and the eternity of each species since creation. But this conclusion must be read in the context of Aquinas’s complex theory of creation and the discussions of the problem of universals in late Scholastic philosophy. This context prevents any simple picture of Scholastic thought concerning the issue of species permanence, and it cannot be claimed that either Aristotle or later Scholastics such as Aquinas are responsible for the strong “essentialist” position often attributed to them in the literature. As developed below, it can be argued that the species concept was “hardened” only in the early modern period with the rise of the mechanical philosophy and its attendant preformationist embryology. The “strong essentialist” position often attributed to Aristotle and Scholasticism, is demonstrably a product of later historical developments.[^6]
### Fixism and preevolutionism
How the extraordinary diversity of life have originated? The scientists are in agreement that all living beings have a common origin and that the biodiversity that have in the Earth is the result of four hundred milions of years of evolution. Nevertheless, the idea of change in the living beings have not resulted very obvious in all the stages. Until the `XIX` century the fixist ideas that consider the species immutable, fixed with the passage of time, proliferated. These were some of the most distinguished fixists.

|The Swedish botanist Carl Linné `[Linneo] [1707-1778]` was a convinced fixist. He used the fixity of the species as central axis for his system of classification of animals and plants, that, with modifications, yet maintains in use.|The naturalist and palaeontologist Georges Cuvier [1769-1832] recognized the fossils as rests of living beings that lived in our planet in other stages, but justified its existence like rests of other previous creations that have disappeared by some planetary catastrophe|Some naturalists, like Georges Leclerc [1707-1788], earl of Buffon, doubted of the immutability of the species. Buffon recognized the possibility that a few living beings did originate from others by "degeneration" in consequence of the action of ambiental factors.|

### The transformism or lamarckism
In 1809, Jean-Baptiste of Monet, knight of Lamarck, published his work _Zoological philosophy_ in that he expound his evolutionist theory the first that is detailed, extensive and consistent, known as transformism or lamarckism, substantiated in two ideas that superimpose:
- The organisms change necessarily in the passage of time, in a process that succeed continuously and gradually, of forms more simple to others more complexes.
- The changes in the conditions of the environment that produce in the passage of time provoke in the species the modification of their habits. If the new habits suppose the use of determined organs, these fortify; on the contrary, the disuse debilitate, even will manage to disappear.
   > “The (function, necessity) makes the organ”

   \- Jean-Baptiste of Monet, knight of Lamarck, 1809

The acquired modifications would be transmitted to the offsprings and, with the time, all the population would have changed: the specie transforms. For this motive, the evolutionist theory of Lamarck is also known as the theory of the acquired characters.
### A slow change and gradual: the theory of the natural selection
The second-biggest evolutionist theory formulated in the `XIX` century is one of Charles Darwin. In his work _About the origin of the species_, published in 1859, Darwin provides abundant datums to show that the organisms evolve, and propose a casual explanation for the evolution: the theory of the natural selection. A similar proposal was suggested, independently, by the also British Alfred Russel Wallace [1823-1913].
Darwin supposes that a similar mechanism to the artificial selection, the breeders themselves, could act above the natural populations in his environment. In this mechanism, he denominated natural selection. The Darwinist explanation of the evolution of the organisms by natural selection bases on the following principles:
- The individuals that formed a population varies in the characteristic that possess, like the size or the form.
- Some differences or variations are inherited, that is to say, those transmit to the offsprings.
- Born more living beings of those that can survive. Thus, only some individuals survive the sufficient time to leave offsprings and, between those that do, a few leave more offsprings than others.
- The subset of the population that survives better and produces more offsprings is not a proof to the population. The natural selection produces when the individuals that possess certain characteristics survive and leave more offsprings than others individuals without aforementioned characteristics.
The result is that, throughout successive generations, it will produce a gradual change of those advantageous inherited variants [will augment]; as a consequence, the population evolves.

|In a natural population of giraffes, the individuals present inheritable variations. Some giraffes born with the fronted legs and the neck larger than others, characters that these individuals transmits to its offspring. If the population dispose of abundance of nourishment, having the neck long does not proportionate any advantage.|In the period of scarcity, for example, on account of a drought, the survival of all the offsprings is not possible, since the resources of the environment are limited. In these conditions, the giraffes of long neck have advantage over those of short neck, since they can access to the highest leafs of the trees.|The giraffes of long neck can survive better and, on account of this, will leave more offsprings that also will be the bearers of aforementioned characteristic. In this way, generation after generation, those characters that bring advantage will tend to impose in the population. In consequence, the population changes.|

### The neo-Darwinism and the synthetic theory
In 1900 it produces an occurrence that changed the course, not only the evolutive theory, but the whole Biology of the `XX` century. It “rediscovers” the laws of the heredity proposed by Mendel and, with them, the existence of precise factors [genes] that determined the heredity. The consequence, almost immediately, was the formulation of two new theories:
- The chromosomal theory of the heredity, about the location of the inherited factors in the chromosomes.
- The theory of the mutation, about the changes that produce in the inherited factors.
The discovery of the mutation allow explaining how the variation that exists inside the populations originate? Know that the inherited factors were in the chromosomes helped to comprehend how this variation combines, incrementing them considerably, by the sexual reproduction.
The almost forgotten theory of Darwin received thus a new motivation: if there are hereditary factors that determine the heredity of the characters, the changes in aforementioned factors will originate inheritable changes in the characters, that is to say, evolution.
In the year 1937, Theodosius Dobzhansky recovered in his work Genetic and the origin of the species the ideas of Darwin, although with a major scientist support. The result was the denominated synthetic theory. This theory bases on that the evolutive unit is not the individual, but the population. The selection acts over the individual, but it is the population that evolves.
- The differential reproduction is the mechanism that produces the selection. That is to say, the environmental conditions favour the reproduction of those individuals that are better adapted to those conditions. Thus, a determined set of genes will go constituting little by little the dominant set.
- The evolution produces in a gradual change to the passage of time in the genetic constitution of the populations.
### Saltationism in front of gradualism
Both the theory of Darwin and the synthetic theory are gradualist theories, that is to say, they uphold that the evolutive changes produce as a result of the slow and progressive accumulation of small changes.
Nevertheless, the datums that provide the fossil record does not always fit with this gradualist model.
In the decade of 1970, the US American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge propose an alternative to the gradualist model that they denominate of the uninterrupted equilibriums. This theory bases on:
- The fossil record does not count, but for some exceptions, with the intermediate forms that should appear if the evolution was slow and gradual.
- The evolution succeed very irregularly, with stops and abrupt speed-ups. The new species result of moments of evolutive explosion to those that follows large periods of stability, or “stasis”, in which the species remain practically constants.
This form of thought, opposed to the gradualism, is known as saltationism.

### Neutral theory
Other theory that explains certain aspects of the neo-Darwinism is the neutral theory, proposed in 1968 by the Japanese specialist in genetic of populations Motoo Kimura. This theory bases on the following principles:
- Many of the changes that occurred in the DNA are neutral in front of natural selection. The changes that produce in the sequences of DNA and, in consequence, in the proteins, usually they are adaptively neutrals, that is to say, they have less or no effect over the function of the molecules.
- The chance is, more than the natural selection, who determines the variations.
In the beginning, this theory was received as an argument against the theory of Darwin of the evolution by natural selection. Nevertheless, its author upheld that both theories were compatibles, since the neutralism does not negate the role of the natural selection in the determination of the curse of the adaptative evolution. In any case, the theory attributes a big role to the genetic adrift.
## Actual state of the evolutive theories
### The new synthesis
It is probable that distinct aspects of the evolution have its explanation in different mechanisms and that the new evolutionist theories could integrate with in the synthetic theory. In this sense, some contradictions between these theories and the synthetic theory are only apparent.
- Although the majority of the genetic variations are neutrals and do not have selective value [neutralism], it is sufficient with a few variations with adaptative character to make interfere the natural selection in the evolution [synthetic theory].
- One encounter point between the gradualism of the synthetic theory and the saltationism of the intermittent equilibrium can find it in the concept of evolution in mosaic. For a same specie, certain characters remain stable during large periods of time while others evolve gradually.
### Evo-devo: the new paradigm?
The neo-Darwinism explains very well the fine adjustment of the organisms to its environment (in which it knows as microevolution). But, how it explains the big changes (macroevolution or evolutive changes that derives in new species) that are behind of the saltationism? The response could come of an emerging evolutive theory that it knows as evo-devo [of evolution and development] and that relates the changes that are in the origin of the biggest groups of organisms with changes in relevant genes for the embryonic development.
The studies of finals of the `XX` century about the genetic control of the embryonic development in the animals revealed that the number of genes that determine the corporal design of an individual is incredibly reduced and that, with frequency, are the same genes, or very likenesses, in different organisms.
Yet, it resulted more surprising to check that these few genes can control processes of the development very different between themselves.
The conclusion is that the huge morphologic diversity of the animals are generated by a very small group of genes, in which it knows as “box of genetic tools”; to it, it recurs reiterately to construct the body of any animal. This implies that small variations in these “tools” can be the origin of important morphologic newnesses.

> Only one gene is the cause of that in the flies appear only one pair of wings. A mutation in this gene originate flies with four wings.

> [!info]
> The _Hox_ genes are a group of genes that determines the basic structure and orientation of the anteroposterior axis of the animals.

The evo-devo, like the interrupted equilibriums, does not refute in some way the neo-Darwinism, but that complete in the framework of an evolutive theory much more comprehensive.
