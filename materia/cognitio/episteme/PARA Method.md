The PARA method is a personal knowledge management system created by time-management coach Tiago Forte.

PARA stands for four core categories:
- Projects
- Areas
- Resources
- Archives

This system is dedicated to helping people organize digital information, such as documents, notes, and files, making it more efficiently accessible and usable.

# Projects
Definition: A project is a series of tasks with specific outcomes and deadlines.
Features: Projects are short-term, dynamic, and change over time.
Examples: Writing reports, organizing events.
# Areas
Definition: Areas are parts of life that require ongoing maintenance and for which you are responsible.
Features: Areas are relatively stable, requiring regular review and updates but lacking a specific end time.
Examples: Health, finances, personal development.
# Resources
- Definition: Resources are collections of information and knowledge about specific topics or interests.
- Features: Resources may support projects or areas but are not directly linked to specific activities or responsibilities.
- Examples: Summaries of books, research materials, educational courses.
# Archives
- Definition: Archives are projects, areas, and resources that are no longer active or currently needed.
- Features: Archives store infrequently used information but are always ready for retrieval.
- Examples: Documents from completed projects, outdated resources.

**Benefits of Using PARA**

- **Reduces decision fatigue**: Clear categories simplify decisions about how to organize and access information.
- **Increases efficiency**: Systematizing information by category allows for faster retrieval of what you need.
- **Supports personal and professional development**: Projects and areas drive goals and personal growth, while resources and archives support these efforts.

**Steps to Implement PARA**

1. **Review existing information**: Check your existing notes, files, and materials.
2. **Categorize**: Classify information according to PARA's four categories.
3. **Maintain**: Regularly review projects and areas to ensure information is active and relevant.
4. **Migrate**: Move inactive information to archives.

The PARA method can be applied to different platforms and tools, such as note applications (e.g., Obsidian, Evernote, Notion), document storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), etc. The key is to establish an organizational system that fits these four categories.
