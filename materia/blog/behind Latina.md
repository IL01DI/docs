`ego esse` means `I am`.
There are two words:
- `ego` is the 1st-person pronoun
- `essere` is the infinitive verb, removing `-re` forms a non-variable present verb. 
# Q&A
## Grammar
### Is your language fusional, agglutinative, or isolating?
Latina is agglutinative and fusional oriented language.
### How do you form inflections?
By changing suffixes.
### Do you have nouns, verbs, and adjectives?
Latina indeed has nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
### Can you make a case?
There are different cases. For example:

| nominative | accusative | genitive | dative  |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ------- |
| mundu      | mundu-a    | mundu-g  | mundu-d | 

### Do nouns have gender?
Of course, but there are 5 of them.

| masculine | femenine | ambiguous | neuter | indefinite |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| puero     | puella   | die       | mundu  | -i         | 

### What else is marked on the noun?
The noun also is marked by:
- Plurality
- Diminutives and augmentatives.

### Does the verb inflect by person and number?
Yes.

### What else can you put on the verb?

### What are the personal pronouns?
Basics word of personal pronouns are:

| person | singular | dual | plural |
| ------ | -------- | ---- | ------ |
| 1st    | ego      | noz  | nos    |
| 2nd    | tu       | voz  | vos    |
| 3rd    | ei       | eiz  | eis    | 

Distinctions may be made:
- by gender in third person
- not by animacy
- by inclusive we and exclusive we
- not by level of formality or politeness
- not by whether 3rd persons are present or not
- not between two sets of third persons (proximate and obviate)
- between real and hypothetical reference: anu

# Zero copula
Only in Vulgara Latina features this: instead of saying `eio esse rex`, we could say `eio rex`.

# Animacy
I disagree this distinction. Life and non-life are hardly explained and cannot be unrelated.

# Negative affirmation

`le rex esse non humanu` is the same as `le rex non esse humanu`, as well as `non le rex esse humanu`.

The word `non` is adverb, which modifies only the verb; thus, the whole sentence too. So there is no need for double negation.

# Concordance
Genre and number must agree between nouns and pronouns themselves if they are related.

# Dual number
The use of dual number would avoid adding too many words.

Instead of saying `duos homos`, we should say `homoz`.

# The first-person dual and plural pronoun
`noz` and `nos` may be ambiguous. `noz` can mean `You and I`, or `he and I` or `She and I`, while `nos` can mean `You and I` or `They and I`.

To solve this ambiguity, we must differ between inclusive either `noz` or `nos` and exclusive either respectively `noz` or `nos`. In other words, creating a compound between `tu` and either `noz` or `nos` means inclusivity because `tu` is included. Otherwise, creating a compound between `ei` and either `noz` or `nos` means exclusivity because `tu` is excluded.

The result is:
- Inclusive `noz` as `tunoz`, which means `You and I`
- Exclusive `noz` as `einoz`, which means either `He and I` or `She and I`
- Inclusive `nos` as `tunos`, which means `You and I (and possibly they)`
- Exclusive `nos` as `einos`, which means `They and I`.

By default, verb doesn't need to agree with; and, if the verb declines in first-person plural and there isn't a personal pronoun related to, then it's assumed to be the ambiguous either `noz` or `nos`.

# Non-personal pronoun
In English, there is a distinction related word between a pronoun and a determiner. For example:

| Pronoun | Determiner     |
| ------- | -------------- |
| ours    | our freedom    |
| this    | this gentleman |
| some    | some frogs     |
| none    | no information |


But some of them aren't. I would say it isn't necessary to differ them.

In Spanish, there isn't any distinction:

| Pronoun | Determiner          |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| nuestra | nuestra libertad    |
| este    | este caballero      |
| algunas | algunas ranas       |
| ninguna | ninguna informaci√≥n |

In this sense, pronouns differs the same way as the nouns using a mechanism:
1. Understanding that a pronoun can be substantive or adjective.
2. Substantive pronoun substitute a noun if there isn't explicitly.
3. Adjective pronoun doesn't substitute a noun, but complement it, if there is explicitly.

			- Non-copula.
	- Adverb. Addition of the verb.

				- Definitive.
				- Non-definitive.
				- Demonstrative.
				- Possessive.
				- Relative (and interrogative).
	- Adposition.
		- Preposition.
		- Postposition.

5. Nouns and non-personal and 3rd-person personal pronouns have 
	- cases:
		- nominative
		- accusative
		- genitive
			- possessive

		- Ambiguous. Corresponds to either or both sex and ends in -e.
		- Neuter. Corresponds to neither sex and ends in -u
		- Indefinite. Doesn't correspond to any section above and ends in -i.
	- 1 non-inflected and 2 inflected numbers:
		- Singular. Corresponds to a single one and doesn't have ending.
		- Dual. Corresponds to two and ends in -z.
		- Plural. Corresponds to more than two and ends in -s.
6. Basic personal pronouns are:
	- ego. 1st-person singular
	- tu. 2nd-person singular
	- ei. 3rd-person singular
	- noz. 1st-person dual
	- voz. 2nd-person dual
	- eiz. 3rd-person dual
	- nos. 1st-person plural
	- vos. 2nd-person plural
	- eis. 3rd-person plural
7. Word order is free.
8. Elision takes effect on pronouns, whose last letter is the same as the first letter of the accompanied noun.
9. Only uppercase would be used on names.
