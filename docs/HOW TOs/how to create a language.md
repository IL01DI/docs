This guide will help you step by step to make a language.

# Subject and Predicate
All languages presents two fundamental elements that cannot be. It is:
- **The subject**. What we speak about.
- **The predicate**. What we refer the subject about.

> [!tip]- Fun Fact
> In this sense, we have now a statement of validity because we can relate between this two whether both are valid each other or not.
> > [!example]
> >> A human fly.
> >
> > “A human” is the subject, while “fly” is the predicate.
> > Now, let's use our reason to demonstrate if it's valid:
> > 1. If a human fly, then a human can fly.
> > 2. However, a human cannot fly at all.
> > 3. Therefore, the sentence “a human fly” is invalid.

But… We still don't have any words yet. To make new words, I recommend storing them on a personal dictionary, so you can track which words you have created. Sadly, it is up to you to generate new words.

# Word order
When making a sentence, you have normally three words in it:
- The subject.
- The verb.
- The object.
However, those basic words would place in some order on a unidimensional line, from the beginning to the end. In other words, a sentence is a tuple of words. Hence, it appears to be six possible options:
- SVO
- SOV
- VSO
- VOS
- OVS
- OSV

A language with a rigid structure tends to be analytic with one fixed type of word order, while a language with a flexible structure tends to be synthetic with a free word order choice.

# Category
Normally, every language should have categorized their words in order to use it properly.
