## Case System

Lingua Latina employs a case system to denote the grammatical roles of nouns within sentences. Each case has a specific function and is marked by distinct suffixes, which helps clarify the relationships between different parts of a sentence. This detailed description of each case includes its function, usage, and examples.

| **Case**       | **Function**               | **Marker** | **Example**                  | **Gloss**              |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Nominative** | Subject of the sentence    | None       | _lo rexo_                    | the king               |
| **Accusative** | Direct object of the verb  | _-a_       | _lo rexo miran lo-a arbor-a_ | the king sees the tree |
| **Dative**     | Indirect object, recipient | _-d_       | _lo rexo ad eio-d_           | the king to him        |
| **Genitive**   | Possession or relationship | _-g_       | _lo rexo-g arbor_            | the king's tree        |

### Nominative Case

#### Function

- **Marks the subject of the sentence**: The nominative case indicates who or what is performing the action or being described.
- **Focus on the subject**: The subject is typically the noun or pronoun that is in focus or that performs the action of the verb.
- **Establishes the main topic**: It establishes the main topic of the sentence and can be used to provide emphasis on the doer of the action.

#### Usage

- **Primary noun or pronoun**: This case is used for the primary noun or pronoun in a sentence.
- **No marker**: It does not have a marker, meaning the form of the noun remains unchanged.
- **Forming declarative sentences**: The nominative case is crucial for forming declarative sentences and for identifying the actor in a sentence.
- **Highlighting the subject**: It is used in both simple and complex sentences to highlight the subject.
- **Questions and exclamations**: The nominative is also used in questions, exclamations, and in coordination to join subjects in compound sentences.
- **Commands and requests**: In commands and requests, the nominative can be used for emphasis or when addressing the subject directly.

#### Examples

##### Simple Sentence

- _lo rexo miran_ (the king sees) - "lo rexo" is the subject performing the action of seeing.

##### Compound Sentence

- _lo rexo miran et lo arbor floran_ (the king sees and the tree blooms) - "lo rexo" and "lo arbor" are both subjects of their respective clauses.

##### Complex Sentence

- _lo rexo, quo miran lo-a arbor-a, esse alto_ (the king, who sees the tree, is tall) - "lo rexo" is the subject of the main clause, and also of the relative clause "quo miran lo-a arbor-a."

##### Subject in Questions

- _lo rexo miran-q?_ (does the king see?) - "lo rexo" is the subject of the interrogative sentence.

##### Subject in Exclamations

- _lo rexo!_ (The king!) - "lo rexo" stands as the subject in an exclamatory sentence, possibly implying surprise or calling attention.

##### Subject in Commands

- _rexo, mira!_ (King, see!) - "rexo" is used as a vocative form (although it is completely replaced by nominative), addressing the subject directly in an imperative sentence.

##### Subject in Coordinated Sentences

- _lo rexo et la rexa miranz_ (The king and the queen see) - "lo rexo" and "la rexa" are joined as subjects performing the action together.

##### Emphatic Subject

- _lo rexo ipse miran_ (The king himself sees) - "lo rexo" is emphasized as the subject performing the action, using "ipse" for added emphasis.

### Accusative Case

- **Function**: Marks the direct object of the verb, which is the entity directly affected by the action. The accusative case answers the questions "what?" or "whom?" in relation to the verb.
- **Usage**:
    - The accusative case is employed to show what is being acted upon by the subject. It is marked by the suffix _-a_, and it plays a critical role in clarifying the object of the action within the sentence structure.
    - It is essential in differentiating the subject (the doer of the action) from the direct object (the receiver of the action).
- **Examples**:
    - _lo rexo miran lo-a arbor-a_ (the king sees the tree)
        - The tree (_arbor-a_) is the direct object of the action "sees" performed by the king (_lo rexo_).
    - _eio donan lo-a libro-a_ (he gives the book)
        - The book (_libro-a_), marked with _-a_, is the object being given, directly affected by the action of giving.
    - _nos facen pan-a_ (we make bread)
        - Bread (_pan-a_) is the direct object of the action "make" performed by us (_nos_).
    - _ego-comedo pom-a_ (I eat the apple)
        - The apple (_pom-a_) is the direct object of the action "eat" performed by me (_ego_).

### Dative Case

- **Function**: Indicates the indirect object, typically the recipient or beneficiary of the action. This case answers the questions "to whom?" or "for whom?" in relation to the verb.
- **Usage**:
    - The dative case is used to denote the recipient or benefactor of an action. It is marked by the suffix _-d_, and it often accompanies verbs that involve giving, sending, or showing.
    - This case is crucial for expressing relationships where an entity receives or benefits from the action, adding clarity to the sentence by specifying who is indirectly affected by the action.
- **Examples**:
    - _lo rexo ad eio-d_ (the king to him)
        - "Him" (_eio-d_) is the indirect object receiving the king's action or benefit.
    - _eio donan lo-a libro-a ad eia-d_ (he gives the book to her)
        - "Her" (_eia-d_) is the recipient of the book, marked by _-d_, showing that she benefits from the giving action.
    - _nos cantan ad amici-d_ (we sing to the friend)
        - The friend (_amici-d_) is the indirect object receiving the action of singing.
    - _ego scribo epistola-a ad mater-d_ (I write a letter to mother)
        - "Mother" (_mater-d_) is the recipient of the letter, benefiting from the action of writing.
    - _ei mittan lo-a flor-a ad tu-d_ (they send the flower to you)
        - "You" (_tu-d_) is the recipient of the flower, marked by _-d_, indicating you benefit from the action of sending.

### Genitive Case

- **Function**: Shows possession or a relationship between nouns. It indicates that one noun belongs to or is associated with another. This case answers the question "whose?" in relation to the noun being described.
- **Usage**: The genitive case is used to express ownership or a relationship between two entities. It is marked by the suffix _-g_, and it often appears in possessive constructions or to denote familial, partitive, or descriptive relationships.
- **Examples**:
    - _lo rexo-g arbor_ (the king's tree) - The tree belongs to the king, with _-g_ indicating possession.
    - _lo rexa-g domo_ (the queenâ€™s house) - The house is owned by the queen, with _-g_ denoting the relationship of ownership.
