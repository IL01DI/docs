### 1. **Sentence Structure**

- **Subject**: The person, place, thing, or idea that is doing or being something in the sentence.
- **Predicate**: The part of the sentence that tells something about the subject. It usually contains a verb and provides information about the action or state of the subject.

**Example**:

- **Simple Sentence**: "The cat sleeps."
    - **Subject**: The cat
    - **Predicate**: sleeps
- **Compound Sentence**: "The cat sleeps, and the dog barks."
- **Complex Sentence**: "When the cat sleeps, the dog barks."

### 2. **Word Order**

- **Basic Order**: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
    - **Example**: "She (S) likes (V) pizza (O)."
- **Modifiers**: Adjectives usually precede the nouns they modify, and adverbs can appear in various positions depending on what they modify.
    - **Example**: "The quick (adj.) brown (adj.) fox jumps (verb) quickly (adv.)."

### 3. **Phrases and Clauses**

- **Phrase**: A group of words that act as a single part of speech but does not contain both a subject and a verb.
    - **Example**: "on the table" (prepositional phrase)
- **Clause**: A group of words containing a subject and a verb. Clauses can be independent (can stand alone as a sentence) or dependent (cannot stand alone).
    - **Example**: "Although he was tired (dependent clause), he finished his work (independent clause)."

### 4. **Types of Sentences**

- **Declarative**: Makes a statement. ("She loves music.")
- **Interrogative**: Asks a question. ("Do you love music?")
- **Imperative**: Gives a command. ("Listen to the music.")
- **Exclamatory**: Expresses strong emotion. ("I love this song!")

### 5. **Agreement**

- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The verb must agree in number (singular or plural) with the subject.
    - **Example**: "She runs." (singular) vs. "They run." (plural)
- **Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement**: A pronoun must agree in number and gender with its antecedent.
    - **Example**: "Everyone has his or her book."

### 6. **Tenses**

- **Present**: "She writes."
- **Past**: "She wrote."
- **Future**: "She will write."
- **Present Perfect**: "She has written."
- **Past Perfect**: "She had written."
- **Future Perfect**: "She will have written."

### 7. **Modifiers**

- **Adjectives**: Modify nouns or pronouns (e.g., "happy child").
- **Adverbs**: Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., "runs quickly").
- **Prepositions**: Show relationships between words in a sentence (e.g., "on the table").

### 8. **Complexity**

- **Simple Sentences**: Contain a single independent clause.
- **Compound Sentences**: Contain two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (e.g., and, but, or).
- **Complex Sentences**: Contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
- **Compound-Complex Sentences**: Contain two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.

### 9. **Subordination and Coordination**

- **Subordination**: Connecting clauses in a way that makes one more important than the other.
    - **Example**: "Because it was raining, we stayed inside."
- **Coordination**: Connecting clauses of equal importance.
    - **Example**: "We went to the park, and we had a picnic."

### 10. **Common Grammatical Issues**

- **Run-On Sentences**: Sentences that improperly join multiple independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions.
    - **Example**: "She loves music she plays the piano."
- **Fragments**: Incomplete sentences that are missing a subject, verb, or complete thought.
    - **Example**: "Although she loves music."
- **Comma Splices**: Joining two independent clauses with a comma without an appropriate conjunction.
    - **Example**: "She loves music, she plays the piano."
