# Manually Starting Waydroid

To start Waydroid without systemctl, you need to follow a few simple steps

**Start the container first:**

```bash
sudo waydroid container start
```

**And in a new terminal tab, start the waydroid session (without** _**sudo**_**):**

```bash
waydroid session start
```

After that starts and you see "Android with user 0 is ready", it is safe to launch an app from the applications menu, or

# Launch Waydroid In Full-Screen Mode:

_(This can be run while Waydroid is running, or used to start it in full-screen mode)_

```bash
waydroid show-full-ui
```

# Launch Waydroid In Multi-Window Mode:

First we need to set the property while a Waydroid session is running:

```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.multi_windows true
```

After that, we can restart the session:

```
waydroid session stop
```

Then we are ready to launch an app, and it will start in multi-window mode

# Reinstalling Waydroid

Sometimes things don't go as planned and you need to remove it all and start over. To do that, follow the steps below:

First, make sure you have stopped the session and containers:

```bash
waydroid session stop
sudo waydroid container stop
```

Then it is safe to remove Waydroid. For example, on debian or ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt remove waydroid
```

After you removed Waydroid, reboot.

Then once logged back in, we need to do a little cleanup:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/waydroid /home/.waydroid ~/waydroid ~/.share/waydroid ~/.local/share/applications/*aydroid* ~/.local/share/waydroid
```

Then you can follow the install instructions again.
